In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to use data persistence to preserve information across different scenes by taking a color that the user selects in the Menu scene and applying it to the transporter units in the Main scene. By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:
1. Ensure data is preserved throughout an application session by using the Unity DontDestroyOnLoad method
2. Recognize when to use static classes, singletons, and static variables to implement data persistence
3. Modify a GameObject with a script that contains the variables to be saved between Scenes

In this tutorial, you’ll write code to save and load the color that the user selects so that it persists between sessions of the application. By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:
1. Call the appropriate start-up methods in the initialization sequence of the app
2. Store and organize data by applying data structures such as lists and dictionaries
3. Save user data in the shutdown sequence of the app
